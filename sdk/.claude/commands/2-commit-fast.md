Generate 3 commit message suggestions following the same format as the commit task
Automatically use the first suggestion without asking the user
Immediately run git commit -m with the first message
All other behaviors remain the same as the commit task (format, package names, staged files only)
Do NOT add Claude co-authorship footer to commits
