## 1.0.0

üéâ **Production Release** - Sequence Marketplace SDK 1.0! üéâ

#### Complete Marketplace Solution

- **Primary Sales (Shop)**: Full support for Sequence sales contracts (ERC721 v0 and ERC1155 v0 and v1)
- **Secondary Sales (Market)**: Comprehensive listing and offer management

### üöÄ New features

- Support for Sequence sales contracts (ERC721 v0 and ERC1155 v0 and v1)
- **New `useProcessStep` hook**: For transaction marketplace api transaction step handling
- **New buy checkout flow UI**: New checkout flow for buying collectibles, from @0xsequence/checkout
- Custom wallet class replaced with wagmi hooks and new hooks for wallet operations (useEnsureCorrectChain, useConnectorMetadata, useProcessStep), see breaking changes below
- All fetching hooks now have a separated query function that can be used with other data fetching libraries or SSR/SSG frameworks
- All fetching hooks only fetch data when all required parameters are provided
- Modal style isolation with shadow DOM, preventing global styles from leaking into the document body
- useSearchTokenMetadata now have an option to only return token metadata for minted tokens `onlyMinted: true`
- MarketplaceConfig is by now by default never invalidated, allow fetching only serverside

- **UI/UX Improvements**:
  - Added optional action buttons to buy flow success modal
  - Fixed ERC1155 quantity modal decimal precision handling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

By default, the SDK now uses shadow DOM for all modals. To disable this, you can set the `useShadowDOM` flag to `false` in the `SdkConfig`. Other components (media, collectible card etc) are rendered to the document body and requires Tailwind.
`useShopCollectibleSaleData` hook has been removed. Instead, use `useErc721SaleDetails` and `useErc1155SaleDetails` hooks leveraging marketplace-api

- **Wallet**: Complete removal of custom wallet client in favor of wagmi hooks
  - Replace `wallet.address` with `useAccount()` hook from wagmi
  - Replace `wallet.isWaaS` with `useConnectorMetadata().isWaaS`
  - Replace `wallet.kind` with `useConnectorMetadata().walletKind`
  - Replace `wallet.switchChain` with `useEnsureCorrectChain` hook
  - Replace `wallet.signTransactionStep` and `wallet.transferStep` with `useProcessStep` hook

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed ERC1155 quantity modal decimal handling with proper min/max calculations
- Fixed pagination issues with minted ERC721 sale tokens
- Resolved potential state management race conditions in action modals
- Fixed decimal handling in quantity inputs
- Fixed collectible card image opacity issues
- Fixed ERC721 sale contract quantity tracking for V1 contracts
- Fixed negative remaining supply display in shop cards
- Improved error handling when quantity values are 0
- Fixed token approval reset when transaction steps don't exist
- Auto fee selection for embedded wallets bug fix, now only applies for cancelling orders

### üîß Internal Improvements

#### Code Organization

- Reorganized hooks into logical subdirectories (data, transactions, ui, config)
- Removed duplicate hooks and consolidated functionality
- Increased test coverage
- Some internal hooks have been renamed for consistency

## 0.10.0

### New Features

**Alternative Wallet integration Support**

- Added support for using any wallet connection library (e.g., Privy, Rainbowkit, Dynamic Labs etc.) instead of Sequence Connect
- You can now provide a custom `openConnectModal` function to the `MarketplaceProvider` to integrate with your preferred wallet connection flow.

Example with any wallet provider:

```tsx
import { MarketplaceProvider } from "@0xsequence/marketplace-sdk/react";
import { useConnectModal } from "@my-wallet-provider/connect-modal";

function App() {
  const { openConnectModal } = useConnectModal();

  return (
    <MarketplaceProvider config={sdkConfig} openConnectModal={openConnectModal}>
      {/* Your marketplace app */}
    </MarketplaceProvider>
  );
}
```

See the [Alternative Wallet Integration Playground](https://github.com/0xsequence/marketplace-sdk/tree/master/playgrounds/alternative-wallets) for a complete example with Dynamic Labs

### Patch Changes

## 0.8.12

### üöÄ Primary Sales Support with Marketplace Shop

‚úÖ **Zero Breaking Changes** - All existing functionality remains unchanged. This release is fully backwards compatible.
This release introduces hooks for usage with the upcoming **Shop**, a new marketplace type that enables primary sales alongside the existing **Market** for secondary sales. You can now handle both minting (primary) and trading (secondary) in a unified marketplace experience.
**What's the difference?**

- **Market** (existing): P2P secondary marketplace for trading existing Collectibles
- **Shop** (new): Primary sales where users mint Collectibles directly using Sequence's sales contracts

## ‚ú® New Features

### Primary Sales Integration

**New Hooks for Shop Operations**

```tsx
// Fetch items available for minting
const { data: saleItems, isLoading } = useListPrimarySaleItems({
  chainId: 137,
  primarySaleContractAddress: "0x1234...",
  filter: { isActive: true },
  enabled: true, // Optional: control when to fetch
});
// Get payment options for minting
const { data: checkoutOptions } = useCheckoutOptionsSalesContract({
  chainId: 137,
  salesContractAddress: "0x1234...",
});
// Track minted tokens from ERC721 sales
const { data: mintedTokens } = useERC721SaleMintedTokens({
  chainId: 137,
  salesContractAddress: "0x1234...",
});
```

**Enhanced Data Fetching**

```tsx
// Get display data for shop collectibles
const { data: shopCardData } = useList1155ShopCardData({
  chainId: 137,
  contractAddress: "0x1234...",
  tokenIds: ["1", "2", "3"],
});
// Batch fetch token supplies across contracts
const { data: suppliesMap } = useGetTokenSuppliesMap({
  requests: [
    { chainId: 137, contractAddress: "0x1234...", tokenIds: ["1", "2"] },
  ],
});
```

### Enhanced Components with `marketplaceType` Support

The following components now accept a `marketplaceType` prop to automatically adapt between Shop (primary sales) and Market (secondary sales) behaviors:
**`CollectibleCard` - Universal Card Component**

```tsx
// For Shop (primary sales) - shows mint actions
<CollectibleCard
  collectibleId="1"
  chainId={137}
  collectionAddress="0x1234..."
  marketplaceType="shop"
  salesContractAddress="0x5678..."
  tokenMetadata={tokenMetadata}
  salePrice={{ amount: "1000000", currencyAddress: "0x..." }}
  quantityDecimals={0}
  quantityRemaining="100"
/>

// For Market (secondary sales) - shows buy/sell actions
<CollectibleCard
  collectibleId="1"
  chainId={137}
  collectionAddress="0x1234..."
  marketplaceType="market"
  collectible={collectibleOrder}
  balanceIsLoading={false}
/>
```

**`useBuyModal` Hook - Universal Purchase Flow**

```tsx
const { show: showBuyModal, close: closeBuyModal } = useBuyModal({
  onSuccess: ({ hash }) => console.log("Purchase successful:", hash),
  onError: (error) => console.error("Purchase failed:", error),
});

// For Shop - opens minting flow
const handleMintClick = () => {
  showBuyModal({
    chainId: 137,
    collectionAddress: "0x1234...",
    marketplaceType: "shop",
    salesContractAddress: "0x5678...",
    items: [{ tokenId: "1" }],
    quantityDecimals: 0,
    quantityRemaining: 100,
    salePrice: { amount: "1000000", currencyAddress: "0x..." },
  });
};

// For Market - opens standard purchase flow
const handleBuyClick = () => {
  showBuyModal({
    chainId: 137,
    collectionAddress: "0x1234...",
    marketplaceType: "market",
    collectibleId: "1",
    marketplace: "sequence",
    orderId: "order-123",
  });
};
```

### Enhanced Existing Features

**Smarter Data Fetching**

- `fetchCollectibles` now automatically detects Shop marketplace types

### üñºÔ∏è‚ÄØNew `Media` component ‚Äì render any type of collectible file

  assets={[
    undefined,
    "ipfs://QmImageHash",
    "https://cdn.example.com/model.glb",
