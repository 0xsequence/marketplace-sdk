## Testing Best Practices Applied

1. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Integrated axe-playwright for automated a11y checks
   - Configured rules to avoid false positives
   - Modal-specific accessibility considerations

2. **Responsive Testing**
   - Added mobile and tablet viewport stories
   - Ensured modals work across different screen sizes

3. **User Interaction Testing**
   - Comprehensive play functions simulating real user behavior
   - Input validation testing
   - Error state handling

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - DOM content loaded timing
   - Page load performance metrics
   - Screenshot capture for visual regression

5. **Cross-browser Compatibility**
   - Configured for Chromium-based testing
   - Can be extended to other browsers

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Complete SellModal story improvements
2. âœ… Complete TransferModal story improvements
3. Run full test suite:
   - First start Storybook: `cd sdk && pnpm storybook`
   - Then run tests: `cd sdk && pnpm test-storybook`
4. Fix any failing tests
5. Generate and review coverage reports
6. Document any component-specific testing requirements
7. Set up CI/CD integration for automated testing

## Commands

```bash
# Run Storybook locally
cd sdk && pnpm storybook

# Run tests
cd sdk && pnpm test-storybook

# Run tests with coverage
cd sdk && pnpm test-storybook --coverage

# Run tests for specific story
cd sdk && pnpm test-storybook --storyNameRegex="BuyModal"

# Build Storybook
cd sdk && pnpm build-storybook
```
